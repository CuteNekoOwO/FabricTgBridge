2. Start the server to generate a default configuration file.
3. Create a telegram bot at [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and obtain your bot token. Remember to disable `Privacy mode` if you want to send group message to minecraft.
4. Open your configuration file (at `config/tgbridge/config.json`) and write in your bot token.
5. Use command `/tgbridge_reload` on your server to reload the configuration.
6. Add your bot to your group, and run `/chatid` in the group to get group chat ID.
7. Write your group chat ID in your configuration file and reload like step 5.
8. Enjoy!

## Configuration

The configuration file is located at `config/tgbridge/config.json`. It's a json file ~~(obviouslyðŸ˜‹)~~.

A detailed explanation is here.

| telegramAPI | String | The API url. Change this if you want to use a reversed proxy. |
| pollTimeout | Int | The bot keeps sending requests to telegram server to obtain new messages. If no new messages is aquired for `value` seconds, the bot will send a request again. **Smaller value is recommended if your network is not good.** |
| sendChatMessage | Boolean | Whether to send game chat messages to your group. |
| sendGameMessage | Boolean | Whether to send game event messages to your group. |
| sendTelegramMessage | Boolean | Whether to send telegram messages to Minecraft. |
| messageTrim | Int | Trim the message sent to Minecraft if it is longer than `value`. Use 0 to disable trimming. |

| admins | String[] | Admins who can run game commands in the group. Use telegram `username`. |

## Localization

### Special telegram message in game

Edit `config/tgbridge/i18n.json`.

### In group server event message

On the PC you play Minecraft, open `minecraft/assets/indexes/{version}.json`. (change {version} to your server version). Search for `{your language code}.json` (such as `en_gb.json`) and remember the `hash` next to it. Now we will use `482e0dae05abfa35ab5cb076e41fda77b4fb9a08` as an example.
Go to `.minecraft/assets/objects/48/` (change `48` to the first to char of the hash), copy the file with name of that hash to somewhere else and rename it `lang.json`. Now you can replace `config/tgbridge/lang.json` with your new file.
